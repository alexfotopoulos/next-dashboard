## Description

next-dashboard is a non-functional clone of a dashboard created by Creative Tim (check out their website <a href="https://www.creative-tim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and a demo of Creative Tim's version here <a href="https://material-dashboard-react-nodejs.creative-tim.com/auth/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).

While the design was created entirely by Creative Tim, all of the code used to create my clone is my own. The dashboard was built using React and NextJs. The dashboard is styled using CSS and SASS. The project is under construction so currently only the dashboard page is completed. The repo/live demo will be updated as more pages are completed.
